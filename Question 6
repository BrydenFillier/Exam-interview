Summarize your experience with khan acadamy.

  To start with summarizing khan acadamy, you must first know that khan acadamy is a platform to learn different skills through lessons 
  and other such things. I used khan acadamy to learn about java script, HTML and other programming languages. I believe that khan is one
  of the better options to learn a coding language from scratch and I achieved just that with minimal help. Another thing khan acadamy
  is used for is monitoring skill level and completion rate of projects. This is to record efficency of students allowing you to encourage
  them on if they fall behind. 
  
    My experience with khan was a long one. While I do believe that khan is a good platform I believe that it also has a majority of flaws.
    The first flaw would be the answer system of the challenges. Khan's challenges do not allow any creativity in the answers and will only
    allow the answer that their program gives hints to. Another flaw is the hint system itself. The hint system is either very 
    obvious or not a hint at all, there is no in between for khan acadamy. I believe that if khan could fix these simple problems then
    the website would be easier to use and attract more users to learn.
