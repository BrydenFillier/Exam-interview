How will you continue learning about computer science?

   For starters learning about computer science is somewhat of a art. In order to accomplish a finished product of art it needs to start
 out as a base and different people work up to something larger in different ways. I believe that the same thing applies to learning 
 computer science. To answer the question of how will I continue learning about computerscience is a multiple step plan that I came up
 with. It includes multiple variables to accomplish my tasks over the summer to prepare myself for university and job oppurtunities.
 
    To start out, my plan over the first month is to code multiple projects, showing advanced knowledge of all the things I learned
    in ICS4U. The next step would be to learn more coding languages such as: Lua, Java, C#, Python and many more. Although I may 
    have started learning some of these languages I believe that it is almost mandatory for me to learn them to the same level
    of knowledge as java script. Lastly I would move on to coding a small indie game to show of my skills as a computer programmer.
