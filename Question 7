Summarize your experience with freecodecamp.

  My experience with freecodecamp was very fantastic. Before we get into the summary, freecodecamp is a challenge based learning of multiple
  coding languages. While freecodecamp is quite diverse in the challenges it gives you, there is not as many modules and coding languages
  as khan. I believe that freecodecamp is generally better than khan for many reasons. Some of the reasons include: flushed out challenge
  system, hint system, UI, and many more.
  
    There are many reasons that I would prefer freecodecamp more than khan. The first reason is the challenge system, in khan acadamy the
    challenge system is too specific in its requirements to complete the challenge. In freecodecamp the challenges are just looking for 
    the proper outputs of the code, this is a massive advantage because you are able to be more creative in freecodecamp allowing you to
    think outside of the box. Another reason I believe that freecodecamp is better than khan is the hint system. In khan the hint system
    is a hit or miss. While in freecodecamp it will build you up to the solution while giving little hints and not revealing the answer to
    the challenge. Those were just some of the reasons why I liked freecodecamp more than khan, while I am sure both websites are excellent
    in their method of teaching, freecodecamp is the closer one to the method of my learning that I enjoy.
